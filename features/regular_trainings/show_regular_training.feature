Feature: View regular training detail
  In order to view training coaches and my playmates
  As training owner, training coach, training player or training player watcher
  I want to view training detail

  Background:
    Given I am logged in
    And User test2 exists
    And Following groups exists in the system
      | name    | description       | long desc     | owner       | visibility  | is_global |
      | group1  | group1 desc       |               | test1       | public      | false     |
    And Following regular trainings exist in the system
      | name      | description     | is_public   | for_group | owner   |

      And User "test1" is in group "group1"
      And I am at the "/regular_trainings" page

    Then I should see "heading" containing "Regular training detail"

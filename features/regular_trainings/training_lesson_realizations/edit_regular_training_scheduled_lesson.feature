Feature: Edit regular training scheduled lesson
  In order to keep information current and have possibility to correct mistakes
  As training owner, head coach, supplementation coach and admin
  I have possibility to edit scheduled lesson

  In regular training lesson there is no possible to change date and time once it is scheduled. Also training
  lesson state can be changed only directly from training lesson detail. Finally currency is taken from regular
  training lesson so we can not change it, too.

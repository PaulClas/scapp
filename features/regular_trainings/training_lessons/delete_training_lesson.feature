  Scenario: As regular training lesson owner I remove training lesson that has no realizations
    Given I have "coach" role
      And I am at the "/regular_trainings/private/training_lessons" page
      And I should see "mon" in the table
    When  I click "Delete" for "mon" in table row
      And I confirm popup
    Then I should see "Regular training lesson was successfully removed." message

  Scenario: As regular training lesson owner I can not remove training lesson that has existing realizations

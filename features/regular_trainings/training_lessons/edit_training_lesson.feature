      And I click "Save changes"
    Then I should see "Regular training lesson was successfully updated." message
      And I should see "11:00" in the date & time table
      And I should see "13:00" in the date & time table
      And I should see "15" in the finance table
      And I should see "18.15" in the finance table
      And I should see "25" in the finance table

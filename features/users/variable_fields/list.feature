      And I shouldn't see "heading" containing "IQ2"
      And "IQ1" "best" value should be "18"
      And "IQ1" "worst" value should be "12"
      And "IQ1" "current" value should be "15"
      And "IQ3-str" "current" value should be "perfect"

  Scenario: I want to view another player VFs as :player
    Given I have "player" role
    When I visit variable_field view results page of "test2"
    Then I should see "You don't have required permissions!" message

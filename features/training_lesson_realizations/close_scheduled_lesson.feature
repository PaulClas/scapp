Feature: Close scheduled lesson feature
  In order to freeze training lesson state and deny any changes
  As training lesson owner, head coach, supplementtaion coach and admin
  I can close scheduled lesson

  Closing scheduled lesson is mainly used because of payments. Only closed lessons can be given to pay. Once closed then
  lesson can be reopened only when no payments are connected to it. Because there could be possibility of inconsistency
  in price on the invoice and real price shown on the training calculated for player!

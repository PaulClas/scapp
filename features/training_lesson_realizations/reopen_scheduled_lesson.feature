Feature: Reopen scheduled lesson
  In order to correct mistakes in closed scheduled lesson
  As admin, scheduled lesson owner or supplementation coach
  I can reopen lesson unless payments are connected to it

  Reopening is permitted only unless this operation si safe. If any payment entry is connected to it, then some
  differences could occur and it is unacceptable! We really do not want to have different prices on the invoice
  and int the backend training lessons listing.

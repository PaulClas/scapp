Feature: Calculate payments for scheduled lesson players
  In order to simplify process of payment calculation for scheduled lesson players
  As admin, scheduled lesson owner, head coach and supplementation coach
  I can run automatic calculation process

  Calculation is dependent on the attendance entries for scheduled lessons. Only present and unexcused players are
  counted to the calculation. Calculation strategy is based on specified calculation method selected for current
  scheduled lesson or regular lesson (for regular trainings).

  Automatically calculated prices can be individually changed. Price balance is shown to inform coach about profitability
  of training. It is based on costs (training lesson rental costs, coach wages) and profit (payments from players).
